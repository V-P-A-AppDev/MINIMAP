# MiniMap Security Fixes Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the MiniMap Android application.

## Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Network Security
**Issue**: Cleartext traffic was enabled, allowing unencrypted HTTP connections
**Fix**: 
- Disabled cleartext traffic: `android:usesCleartextTraffic="false"`
- Added network security configuration (`network_security_config.xml`)
- Enforced HTTPS for all external domains
- Added certificate pinning configuration

### 2. API Key Exposure
**Issue**: Google Maps and Firebase API keys were hardcoded and exposed
**Fix**:
- Updated debug API key placeholder (requires new key generation)
- Added security configuration to restrict API key usage
- Implemented proper key management practices

### 3. Backup Security
**Issue**: App backup was enabled without restrictions, potentially exposing sensitive data
**Fix**:
- Updated backup descriptor to exclude sensitive user data
- Added specific exclusions for user credentials, session data, and chat content
- Only essential app settings are now included in backups

### 4. Code Obfuscation
**Issue**: Code was not obfuscated, making reverse engineering easier
**Fix**:
- Enabled code obfuscation: `minifyEnabled true`
- Added comprehensive ProGuard rules
- Enabled resource shrinking
- Disabled debugging in release builds

### 5. Password Security
**Issue**: Weak password requirements (only 6 characters minimum)
**Fix**:
- Created `PasswordValidator` utility class
- Implemented strong password requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Must contain uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Must contain numbers
  - Must contain special characters
  - No whitespace allowed
  - Checks against common weak passwords
- Updated authentication flow to use new validator

### 6. Input Validation and Sanitization
**Issue**: Lack of input validation and sanitization
**Fix**:
- Created `SecurityUtils` class for input sanitization
- Created `InputValidator` class for comprehensive validation
- Added XSS and injection attack prevention
- Implemented URL validation for image loading
- Added chat message content validation

### 7. Dependency Updates
**Issue**: Outdated dependencies with potential security vulnerabilities
**Fix**:
- Updated target SDK to 34 (Android 14)
- Updated all dependencies to latest secure versions:
  - androidx.appcompat: 1.6.1
  - material: 1.11.0
  - play-services-maps: 18.2.0
  - play-services-location: 21.1.0
  - firebase-bom: 32.7.2
  - glide: 4.16.0
  - geofire-android: 3.0.0

## New Security Features Added

### 1. Password Validator (`PasswordValidator.java`)
- Comprehensive password strength validation
- Common password detection
- Configurable requirements

### 2. Security Utilities (`SecurityUtils.java`)
- Input sanitization methods
- XSS and injection attack detection
- URL validation
- Location coordinate validation

### 3. Input Validator (`InputValidator.java`)
- Email format validation
- Phone number validation
- Name validation
- General text validation
- Location validation

### 4. Enhanced Chat Security
- Message content validation
- User name sanitization
- Image URL validation
- Dangerous content detection

## Configuration Files Updated

### 1. AndroidManifest.xml
- Disabled cleartext traffic
- Added network security configuration
- Maintained necessary permissions

### 2. build.gradle
- Updated target SDK to 34
- Enabled code obfuscation
- Updated all dependencies
- Added security build configurations

### 3. proguard-rules.pro
- Added comprehensive obfuscation rules
- Protected essential classes from obfuscation
- Removed logging in release builds

### 4. network_security_config.xml
- Enforced HTTPS for external domains
- Added certificate pinning configuration
- Allowed cleartext only for localhost (development)

### 5. backup_descriptor.xml
- Excluded sensitive user data from backups
- Protected credentials and session data
- Limited backup to essential app settings

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are now validated and sanitized
2. **Secure Communication**: HTTPS enforced for all network communications
3. **Code Protection**: Release builds are obfuscated and optimized
4. **Data Protection**: Sensitive data excluded from backups
5. **Strong Authentication**: Enhanced password requirements
6. **Dependency Management**: All dependencies updated to latest secure versions

## Recommendations for Further Security

1. **API Key Rotation**: Rotate all exposed API keys immediately
2. **Certificate Pinning**: Update certificate pins with actual Firebase certificates
3. **Runtime Protection**: Consider implementing RASP (Runtime Application Self-Protection)
4. **Security Testing**: Perform penetration testing on the updated application
5. **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and logging
6. **Regular Updates**: Establish a process for regular security updates

## Testing Security Fixes

1. Test password validation with various inputs
2. Verify HTTPS enforcement for network requests
3. Test input sanitization with malicious content
4. Verify backup exclusions work correctly
5. Test code obfuscation in release builds
6. Validate API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console

## Notes

- The debug Google Maps API key still needs to be replaced with a new one
- Certificate pins in network security config need to be updated with actual certificates
- Consider implementing additional security measures based on threat modeling
- Regular security audits should be performed on the application
